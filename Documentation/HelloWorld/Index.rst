Introduction
============

.. warning::
   this introduction is just a draft and should be rewritten

The system extension CKEditor can be extended via plugins; it comes with a series of standard plugins located in the folder `EXT:rte_ckeditor/Resources/Public/JavaScript/Contrib/plugins/` . This section contains the complete list of plugins and how they should be added to your `.yaml` config file (See `<insert link here how to use your own config file>`)


.. warning::
   I don't know how to say it...some plugins are already added to the standard config files shipped with TYPO3
   ( `minimal.yaml`, `default.yaml`, `full.yaml` but all the following examples refer to the miminum configuration
   so I assume the user wants to add them to `minimal.yaml`


.. warning::
   Add a paragraph with the link about how to install your own plugin (another page)

   Additional information
      if the options `config.templates` and `config.teplates_files` are not set, a default is loaded. The default 
      file is located at EXT:rte_ckeditor/Resources/Public/JavaScript/Contrib/plugins/templates/templates/default.js
      You can also look at this example: https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor-dev/blob/master/plugins/templates/templates/default.js 
      
      If you want to use preview images for your template, it is advisable to copy the same folder structure inside EXT:rte_ckeditor/Resources/Public/JavaScript/Contrib/plugins/templates/templates/
      
      .. danger::
         in the js file the path for the preview images is calculated on the position of the CKEditor itself;
         you can use an absolute path if needed: this works:
         .. code-block:: javascript
            imagesPath: 'https://typo3.9.yourdemo.it:8890/typo3conf/ext/bhsiteconf/Resources/Public/templates/images/',
